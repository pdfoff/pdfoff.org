# Defining the Problem (and Solution)
Lots of people in the open government space believe that all but very well planned and tagged PDFs are essentially impossible to use reliably to obtain meaningful, well-structured data. 

It is believed that slight variations in layout, the occasional element with handwritten detail, scanned (and skewed) image-only version of a PDF form all represent, represent gigantic hurdles to obtaining well-structured, comprehensive data via an automated process.  

We, the organizers of PDFOFF, disagree.

We believe that the most common scenario of working with a large  collection of PDF documents that are similar in layout and content is a scenario that is surmountable with current technologies. 

We believe that a collection of similar PDF documents exhibit clear patterns underlying structures and visual distinct and detectable relationships between elements on the page that are both well within the capabilities of today's computer vision, heuristics, schema extraction, and adaptive learning techniques. 

Given a collection of 30 to several thousand PDF documents that are each substantially similar to each other in layout elements and subject matter, it should be possible with less than four hours of preparatory work by a person to then automatically extract meaningful structured data from 90%+ of the documents. 

In other words, we are seeking a set of easy to use tools that an individual with reasonable word processing computer skills could train in a half day or less to extract structured data from a large collection of PDF documents commonly found in the enterprise environment with which the individual had reasonable knowledge of the subject matter.

Because it is likely any large collection of PDFs documents could contain a few, or many, documents that are scanned image PDFs, we are including scanned images as part of the collections. Our belief is that given 

Because we are considering a collection of PDF documents commonly found in the enterprise environment (including government), we are including documents that are purely scanned images PDFs in addition to generated PDFs because
